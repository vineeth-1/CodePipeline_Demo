Hey guys, 

These files are used in project where we automate the generation of image using CodePipeline.

I've divided this project into 5 steps:

1. Setting up CodeCommit (Private Code Repository).
2. Creating a project in CodeBuild.
3. Setting up CodePipeline.
4. Test the Application.
5. Cleanup

I've discussed cost element in the end which is almost zero under free-tier (Except for ECS).

You can follow this post to have a walk through of this demo
